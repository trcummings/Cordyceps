Cordyceps is a psychedelic platform jumper web game where you, the player, a humble janitor for a fungal research center, wake up to find yourself in the midst of an outbreak that has harrowing consequences for all infected!

Run, jump, and avoid your fallen coworkers as you try and escape the facility. Sometimes, however, infection is inevitable. Get to the nearest fumigation chamber to survive before you lose all grip on material reality!

## Future Directions

### NPM package for physics engine

Currently, the dev team (okay, okay, it's just me) is hard at work putting together the current physics engine, object management, sprite rendering, and dynamic camera system into a NPM package called GlassPocket.
