# Cordyceps

Cordyceps is a psychedelic platform jumper web game where you, the player, a biotech engineer working on a new strain of monoculture fungus, are caught in the middle of a factory-wide contamination. You have to get from fumigation chamber to fumigation chamber before the spores subsume your entire cognitive reality.

### MVP

Cordyceps includes:

* Responsive jumping and running controls
* Collision detection (including ramps)
* A dynamic floating camera which follows the player, changing position, size, and distance, based on the in-game narrative demands
* Event triggers and goal states, including player death and player success
* Responsive environmental feature (giant mushrooms to bounce on, etc)
* Rudimentary enemy AI
* A thematically styled landing page
* A colorful and terrifying world
